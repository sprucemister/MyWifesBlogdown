I am exhausted by my dust. 

Gazing out the window to the right, I see a perfect Oklahoma winter sunrise. Seagulls (yes there are seagulls in landlocked Oklahoma) diving wildly into the insanely pink streaks that run through the wide sky. Why are the sunrises so pretty in the winter? And in one beat. I will miss this. 

But let me muse, if 3 + months go by, no visa, and still in the United States:

I am missing Japan. I am tired of here. Why are we not there yet? 



This has played out many times. A CD looping back on itself. A child’s half broken toy that has sentimental quality. Will miss. The lake near where we live. Will miss. The sweet lawn guy Leo. Will miss. Heck, chick fil a. Will miss (don’t judge). 



When the imminent is change, it’s a will miss. When it’s pushed out, it’s a why am I here. 



And that’s the exhausting part. Two worlds. Is everyone living in two worlds? 



The liminal stage as I’ve learned recently reading Third Culture Kids: “the space between things, the neither here nor there and neither this nor that”. And I would say Stewart and I have lived in this liminal stage for most of our marriage. Feeling called to Japan and normal life things pausing it. Then restart, pause, rewind, replay. And now, close to starting the next song. 



Over that time we’ve fought the feelings of wanting to detach to make it “easier” for years. 

We’ve at times reluctantly planted roots, already contorting our faces in pain anticipating future goodbyes at the uproot. We’ve forgone furniture purchases because why buy it here when we will soon sell it. It’s a weird two worlds.  





I look up to take a picture of the sunrise to remember it and see a uniform blue sky. The sun is up. The seagulls still wild. 

Pink is gone. 



Even closer to a time of departure, we wonder if the will miss will turn into why am I still here. 



My dust collects as time continues through all of this. And I’ve learned that living in the liminal stage has good, too. 

I know there’s a goodbye and live knowing that’s soon. By nature I’m a past or future person. Living liminal makes me think also about the present. We have less stuff. Which is just…easier. 



I’m exhausted by my fickleness, though. But I’ll wait till the sunrise of tomorrow and take a picture then, hoping it will be just as miraculous as the one today.
