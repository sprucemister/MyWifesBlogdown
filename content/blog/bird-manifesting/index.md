I’m weary and relieved. Judah finally has no fever for over 24 hours, so we head to the
park. My son climbs a tree (he's in a delightfully nostalgic tree climbing phase). Leaning on
a bouncing branch, he peers into the distance and sees grey-blue pigeons marching on the
ground. My Tokyo abiding offspring don't see the array of birds they once did.

Immediately (and forcefully) my mind waltzes back over to America and a big blue lake. I'm
meandering on a spring day around the walking path and see swaths of seagulls peppering
the sky white. On windy days, I'd see birds playing effortlessly with the frantic wind
currents. Pelicans are diving to retrieve fish in the lake. The little boy brains don't
remember that much now, but I do. Ill hold onto it for them.

Judah leaps onto the ground and I'm back in Japan just like that. He begins to flap his
arms and mimic sounds. Of course, the pigeons are not convinced this is one of their kind,
so they fly off. A few more times of this and Judah becomes angry. He wants the bird
friends to stick around.

“I think they know you're not one of them, love.”

I often feel a similar frustration as I move through a country so different than my own. I'm
not Japanese. I don't look it, I sure as heck don't act like it. I'm not fooling anyone here,
right? My babies bear the resemblance of their tall white father and their short white
mother.

These things don't stop me from attempting to flap my wings like a Japanese. Why? Well, if
you're a bird I'm a bird. But, I'm learning my line. The line of 'I want to respect you, I value
your way of walking in this world' versus 'I want to be you, something I'm not'

What a swirling and muddy line that is. My faith is a flashlight, guiding me through the muck
to see the line. To see joyfully living in who I am can exist with who Japan is. Sometimes, it
feels like they collide right?

I heard recently that good parenting can be defined as a parent helping raise a child in a
way that conforms to the culture that they interact with.

While this definition made me initially want to bury my face in a pillow and scream, it also
gave me some peace. Ohh yeah… I wasn't raised by Japan. I was raised by loving,
American parents. So, no wonder I feel out of place. But does that make me any less?
Heck *no*. Does this make me any different? Heck *yes*.
In our house we say, different can be good.

Whatever piece of land I’m standing on, I am Emma.

Who I am is creative.

Who I am is loud and timid

flighty

Merciful

brave

weak

Who I am is restored

Do I have a beautiful opportunity to show my kids how to respect others way of living and
be a learner while being confident and true to yourself? Whoa buddy, I have a plethora of
opportunities to show my kids how to graciously fail. How lucky am I? How lucky am I, that I
am experiencing a new way to be.
